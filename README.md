# yaml-crypt

Encrypt secret strings in your yaml config files using a cloud-based encryption service, while leaving the rest of the file readable.

![Test](https://github.com/farmersedgeinc/yaml-crypt/workflows/Test/badge.svg?branch=tests)

## Concepts

Each file managed by yaml-crypt has 3 "versions": the _encrypted version_, the _decrypted version_, and the _plain version_. The _encrypted version_ has any secret values in the file replaced with encrypted represenations; the _decrypted version_ contains plaintext values, with any secrets marked with the tag `!secret`, and the _plain version_ contains a plain yaml file, with all yaml-crypt-specific tags removed.

The **encrypted version** of a file is what you want to track in git; all non-secret values are visible as normal, while encrypted representations of secrets live inline in the document flow, only changing when their contents change. This means that git diffs will look normal and be perfectly readable, with the exception that the secret values are not visible, other than revealing _whether they have changed at all_. With the exception of the secret values, this file is also directly editable; if someone does not have access to the encryption service, they are still able to view and edit non-secret values.

The **decrypted version** of a file is the fully editable version of a file. Secret values are shown as plaintext YAML strings, prefixed with the YAML tag `!secret`. New secrets can be added by simply adding values with the `!secret` tag to any YAML string value in the file. To avoid conflicts, always run `decrypt` on a file before editing it, in case the underlying _encrypted version_ has changed. (However, keeping the decrypted file around helps speed things up; yaml-crypt uses hashes in the _encrypted version_ to avoid sending requests to the cloud provider except when secrets have changed).

The **plain version** of a file is basically just the _decrypted version_ without the `!secret` tags. This means that this file is basically read-only; since there are no tags, yaml-crypt has no way of knowing which values should be encrypted, so don't edit this file! This file is generated for external applications to consume.

## Requirements

### Google

You need valid Google Cloud credentials set up. The easiest way to do this is to install and set up [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/), and run `gcloud auth application-default login`.

Your account needs access to Google [Cloud KMS](https://cloud.google.com/security-key-management), and the role `roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter` for the key to be used.

## Usage

```
yaml-crypt --help
```

Although, mostly you'll just `yaml-crypt edit` to edit files, and `yaml-crypt decrypt --plain` in CI scripts.

If you're performing bulk edits on many files, you can run `yaml-crypt` before editing, and `yaml-crypt encrypt` afterwards.

To **create a new file**, just create a file with the _decrypted version_ suffix, (by default, that's `.decrypted.yaml`), and add your content, prefixing any string values you want to protect with the `!secret` YAML tag, and run `yaml-crypt encrypt <yourfile>`, and `git add` the new _encrypted version_ (by default, `<yourfile>.encrypted.yaml`).

To **set up a new repo**, run `yaml-crypt init <provider>` with the name of the encryption provider (currently, the only supported one is `google`). A `.yamlcrypt.yaml` file will be created, containing all the configuration for your repository, as well as some keys with blank values in the `config` section, for configuring the provider.

### Note About Editors

**If you're not the sort of nerd who customizes your environment, you probably don't need to worry about this.** `yaml-crypt edit` is basically the equivalent of running `yaml-crypt decrypt "$FILE" && "$EDITOR" "$FILE" && yaml-crypt encrypt "$FILE"`. This process makes one critical assumption: that your editor will only exit after you've finished editing the file. This holds true for any terminal-based text editor (`vim`, `nano`, `emacs`, etc), and for some GUI editors like `gedit` and `mousepad`. However, Sublime Text (`subl`), Atom (`atom`), and VSCode (`code`), all fork to a background process and immediately exit, which breaks the core assumption of `yaml-crypt edit`. `subl`, `atom`, and `code` all accept a `-w` flag to make the process wait for the window/tab to be closed before exiting though. You can set `EDITORFLAGS=-w` in your shell config (`.bashrc`, etc) to fix editing if your `$EDITOR` is `subl`, `atom`, or `code`.

### Decrypted Git Diffs

To see decrypted secret values in your git diffs, add the following to your repo's `.gitattributes`:

```
*.encrypted.yaml diff=yamlcrypt
```

Assuming you have yaml-crypt globally installed on your machine, you can then add the following to either your local repo config (`.git/config`), or your global git config (`~/.gitconfig`):

```
[diff "yamlcrypt"]
    textconv = yaml-crypt decrypt --stdout
    cachetextconv = true
```

Yaml-crypt can't perform its usual caching optimizations when being asked to directly decrypt git objects, so it will run slower than a regular `yaml-crypt decrypt` would. Setting `cachetextconv = true` will help by having git cache the plaintexts of each git object. **Warning:** you should only be using yaml-crypt on a secure machine anyways, but be aware that git's local `textconv` cache is additional place that sensitive data can reside.

## Security Notes

Yaml-crypt stores salted sha256 hashes of the plaintexts in the _encrypted version_, meaning low-entropy secrets are subject to brute-force attacks. For the sake of reasonable security, any secret values stored using yaml-crypt should contain at least 128 bits of entropy; for a randomly generated `[a-zA-Z0-9]*` password, this means **at least 22 characters** (128 bits was chosen as a safe margin since performing 2^128 of _any_ operation is likely physically impossible in non-astronomical time). In the future a mode may be added to avoid hashes and use deterministic encryption instead, but this is currently unsupported.

Yaml-crypt automatically adds the suffixes for the _decrypted_ and _plain_ versions of files to the `.gitignore`, but it is still the user's responsibility to make sure these files never end up in git history!

## Examples

```
% cat <<EOF > testfile.decrypted.yaml
key: value
just: a regular value
except: !secret this one is a secret,
but: not this one
EOF
% ./yaml-crypt encrypt testfile.decrypted.yaml
% cat testfile.encrypted.yaml
key: value
just: a regular value
except: !encrypted {salt: Fgj8nT0W6QzoJvE3qutjSg==, hash: 1pxSNrH5e29mll/LglMWPw==, data: CiQAGygkv+rQz7w4siamOGllx/2WLW1vRJljndLAeaShWFJh8/ESPgDnaSWzeXJ+9wtBoG/j+Y3VHn+5AZP78aTMBsIVgR5s5h4om58otx/Tdez+iTy0ZVkVDEPrcPsDQ2JPuxvU}
but: not this one
% ./yaml-crypt decrypt testfile.encrypted.yaml
% cat testfile.decrypted.yaml
key: value
just: a regular value
except: !secret this one is a secret,
but: not this one
```

## Development

Pretty simple, just builds with `go build`. Test with `go test -v ./...`; the tests will automatically detect if you have credentials for the crypto providers, however, if you have credentials that aren't valid the tests will fail.

Make sure to `go fmt` any code you submit!
